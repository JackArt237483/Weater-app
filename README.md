# Weater-app
Hello, dear user! Below, you'll find instructions for installing the application on your computer:

First, open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
Navigate to the project repository and click on the green button to get the repository link.
Copy this link.
Switch back to VS Code and open the terminal at the bottom.
Paste the copied link into the terminal and use the command git clone followed by the repository link.
After cloning, navigate to the extension stack in VS Code and install Live Server.
Once the extension is installed, go to the HTML document of the project, right-click, and select "Open with Live Server."
This will open the weather app locally in your browser.
You'll find yourself on a search page where you can enter any city or country.
Upon entering a city, you'll immediately receive information about the weather, including the current temperature and date.
You can reload the page or click the back arrow in the upper left corner to return to the city input page.
Thank you for reading. Good luck using the application!
